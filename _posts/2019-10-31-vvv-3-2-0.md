Hi! Welcome to the very late release post for VVV <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/releases/tag/3.2.0"> v3.2.0</a>.

This is a big update that change few things but implements also a lot of things. Note that to update require a `vagrant up --provision`. 

## VVV updates

### Enhancements

 - Improved output of `xdebug_on` and `xdebug_off`
 - Updated the default config to reference PHP 7.4 support
 - webgrind is now provisioned using composer
 - Added support for the vagrant-disksize plugin if available
 - Site provisioner output is now piped to the log file to simplify the terminal output. Errors should still be sent to the terminal
 - Utility provisioner is now piped to the log file to simplify terminal output

We are not using anymore `vvv-config.yml` or `vvv-custom.yml` but `config/default-config.yml` and `config/config.yml`. This migration of path is automatically done during the update or a new provision. We updated accordingly all the code, provisionsers and documentation but the content of the file is the same.  
Also all the provisioners and VVV itself are writing the output on the log. Also in terminal is printed only the errors so is more easy to do debug (and also reporting them).  
And just because the updates to the log are not finished yet we added colors and timing of running!

Now VVV alert if the YAML is broken and the web VVV dashboard inform all the users if there is a new version of VVV.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed cloning site provisioners into empty directories
 - Enabled MailHog for all PHP versions
 - Removed trailing spaces from all provisioner files and configs
 - `my.cnf` is now readable by the vagrant user
 - Fixes to newline substitution in the splash screen and some rearrangement
 - MySQL binary logging is now disabled
 - Synced folder permission fixes for VMWare
 - Shared DB mounts are now mounted on Parallels and VMWare
 - Fixed `/var/log` being mounted on Parallels, HyperV, and VMWare
