If you installed VVV via a `zip` download rather than using `git`, you can still convert your install without reinstalling from scratch. This way you can keep your copy of VVV updated. 

Before doing this though, make sure you've copied `config/default-config.yml` to `config/config.yml`, any changes to that file will be overwritten.

> Note: You should review the [News &amp; Changelog](/blog/) blog. Sometimes you will also need to update the underlying software such as Vagrant, its plugins or VirtualBox in order for this process to be successful.

First, navigate in the terminal to the VVV folder, and run the following commands:

```shell
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git
git fetch
git reset origin/master
git checkout -f origin/master
git checkout master
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
git pull
```

Once this is done, run `vagrant reload --provision` to update.
