`config/default-config.yml` is the default config file that VVV uses to set itself up. Copy this file to `config/config.yml` to make changes and add your own site.

**Before VVV 3.2 the file was `vvv-config.yml` and `vvv-custom.yml` in the VVV root.**

Here's the full default config file, with every key and option that VVV supports:

```yaml
sites:
  wordpress-default:
    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git
    vm_dir: /srv/www/wordpress-default
    local_dir: /Users/janesmith/dev/www/vvv/www/wordpress-default
    branch: master
    skip_provisioning: false
    allow_customfile: false
    nginx_upstream: php
    hosts:
      - local.wordpress.test

  wordpress-develop:
    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop.git
    local_dir: /Users/janesmith/dev/www/vvv/www/wordpress-develop
    branch: master
    skip_provisioning: true
    allow_customfile: false
    nginx_upstream: php
    hosts:
      - src.wordpress-develop.test
      - build.wordpress-develop.test

vm_config:
  memory: 2048
  cores: 1
  #box: custom-box # Override the vagrant box with a custom one

    - tls-ca

## Anatomy of a Site config

Let's break apart the `wordpress-default` site:

```yaml
sites:
  wordpress-default:
    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git
    vm_dir: /srv/www/wordpress-default
    local_dir: /Users/janesmith/dev/www/vvv/www/wordpress-default
    branch: master
    skip_provisioning: false
    allow_customfile: false
    nginx_upstream: php
    hosts:
      - local.wordpress.test
```

When defining a site, the only required item is the name of the site. This single line would be a perfectly valid site definition:

```yaml
example-site:
```
Note that site provisioners may add their own custom values, see the [custom-site-template](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/blob/master/README.md) documentation on GitHub for information on what is supported.

### repo

This specifies a git repository that contains the site to be provisioned. If set, VVV will grab the git repo, place it in the appropriate place, and provision the site.

There's also a shorthand version:

```yaml
example-site: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git
```

### branch

If the `repo` key is being used, and the `branch` key is set, VVV will checkout that branch instead of `master`.

### vm_dir

This controls the folder inside the virtual machine the sites folder is mapped on to.

### local_dir

This controls which folder on the host machine VVV uses for this site. By default, it uses a folder with the sites name inside the `www` subfolder.

For example, a site named `test` would be inside the `www/test` folder.

### skip_provisioning

If there are a lot of sites in `vvv-custom.yml`, you may want to skip several sites that aren't in use. To do this, set the `skip_provisioning` key, for example:

```yaml
sites:
  wordpress-default:
    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git
    skip_provisioning: true
```

Now VVV will skip that site when running the provisioner. This means that the hosts, nginx config, and `vvv-init.sh` script will not be copied or ran.

### allow_customfile

It may be necessary to run a ruby script during provisioning to do more complex things. This might be installing system wide packages inside the virtual machine, etc.

It's recommended that instead, the `utilities` section should be used when possible. Writing your own Vagrant Ruby code is an in-depth topic and could destabilise VVV if done incorrectly. This should only be used by advanced users with knowledge of the subject.

Note that `Customfile` will be looked for in the site's `local_dir`, or in the VVV installation folder.

### nginx_upstream

This option sets where Nginx passes requests to, and is primarily for setting the PHP version used. [You can read more about it here](adding-a-new-site/changing-php-version.md).

### hosts

This defines the domains and hosts for VVV to listen on. If the vagrant host plugin is installed, your hosts file will automatically be updated when the machine is turned on and off

```yaml
hosts:
  - local.wordpress.test
```

## vm_config

These settings control the Virtual Machine that Vagrant creates. By default this is 2048MB of RAM and 1 core.

This configuration would tell VVV to create a virtual machine with 4GB of RAM and a single CPU core:

```yaml
vm_config:
  memory: 4096
  cores: 1
```

## general

This section is used for general options for the suite.

### db_backup

Backup the databases to the database/backups subfolder on halt/suspend/destroy, set to false to disable.

### db_restore

Imports the databases if they're missing from backups, set to false to disable.

### db_share_type

Set to true to use a synced shared folder for MariaDB database storage, could create issues on different systems. This is `false`/off by default

### github_token

Tells composer can use a GitHub token to speed up download and avoid rate limiting issues when downloading packages.

## Utilities

These are repositories and packages VVV pulls in to provide additional services, such as PHPMyAdmin, TLS certificate authorities or MemcachedAdmin.

[Additional versions of PHP](adding-a-new-site/changing-php-version.md) may also be added here.

## vagrant-plugins

This section is used for settings for the plugin supported by VVV, use as reference the config.yml file.
