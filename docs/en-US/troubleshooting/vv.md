The abandoned `vv` command can cause issues when using with VVV 2 and above.

## Host Issues When Using The `vv` Command
 
The problem is that `vv` doesn't add hosts to the `vvv-custom.yml` file, so you need to add the site and its hosts to the `vvv-custom.yml` file then reprovision. If you don't do this, VVV will be unaware that the site `vv` tried to set up exists.

`vv` doesn't fully support VVV 2+, and a lot of its features were integrated into VVV 2 making the tool unnecessary. The `vv` project has also been abandoned by its maintainers.

### Nginx Configs

Normal VVV sites have an nginx config in the `provision` folder called `vvv-nginx.conf`, or a template that creates one on provision. It gets copied into the right place when VVV provisions, but `vv` doesn't use this, and puts the configs in place manually. This can cause problems when following instructions, especially when changing site domains and URLs.

You can get around this by going into the virtual machine, and copying the config to your sites folder under a `provision` subfolder, then deleting the original and reprovisioning.

## How Do I Add New Sites Then?

Using the custom site template and the config. All you need to do is edit the VVV config file at `vvv-custom.yml`. See the Adding a new site section of this site for a walkthrough.
