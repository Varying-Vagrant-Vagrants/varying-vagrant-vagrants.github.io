### Contributing to WordPress Core

If you wish to contribute to WordPress core itself, you can use the `custom-site-template-develop` instead.

**Note:** For everyday client work, such as plugin or theme development, use a normal site template. This template is for contributor days, and testing/patching WordPress itself

The default VVV config comes with a disabled site that uses this template, just change `skip_provisioning: true` to `skip_provisioning: false`, then reprovision VVV.

### Contributing to WordPress Meta

There is a meta environment maintained by the WordPress team, it provides a way to work with:

 - buddypress.org
 - jobs.wordpress.net
 - wordcamp.org
 - wordpress.org
   - developer.wordpress.org
   - global.wordpress.org
   - translate.wordpress.org.
 - wordpress.tv

It also provides some starting content. To enable it, set `skip_provisioning: false` on `wordpress-meta-environment` in your config file and reprovision. If it isn't present, you can copy it from the default config file. For more information visit [the meta-environment github repository](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment).
