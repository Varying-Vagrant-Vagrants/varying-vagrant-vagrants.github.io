Varying Vagrant Vagrants is an open source [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) configuration focused on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) development.

VVV is ideal for developing themes and plugins as well as for [contributing to WordPress core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/).

## Objectives

* Approachable development environment with a modern server configuration.
* Stable state of software and configuration in default provisioning.
* Excellent and clear documentation to aid in learning and scaffolding.

Read more about the [history of VVV](docs/en-US/history/), the [governance of the project](docs/en-US/governance/), and [how you can contribute](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements

VVV requires recent versions of both Vagrant and VirtualBox to be installed.

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is a "tool for building and distributing development environments". It works with [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization) software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to provide a virtual machine sandboxed from your local environment.

In addition to VirtualBox, provider support is also included for Parallels, Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, and VMWare Workstation.

## Documentation

The [documentation](docs/en-US/) area of this site is in progress. The [VVV Wiki](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/wiki) contains documentation that may help.
